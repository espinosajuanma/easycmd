# easycmd

This is my first go module intended to make a easy command handler for simple go cli applications

There is a lot of nice commanders writing in go. But I wanted to make one with my own preferences

Simple enough just to make a quick cli app:
- No flags
- No autocomplete
- Just the necesary to set a main subcommand and set a list of aliases
